/* 
The JavaScript filter() method is used to filter an array based on a specified criteria. It returns a new array with the values that pass the filter.
The filter() method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called once for each element in the array. The callback function must return a Boolean value. If the callback function returns true, the element is included in the new array. If the callback function returns false, the element is not included in the new array.
